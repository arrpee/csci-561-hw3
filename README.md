# CSCI 561 HW3: Digit Recognition

This repository contains the code for a programming assignment involving digit recognition using neural networks on a modified version of the MNIST dataset.

A description of the assignment can be found in the [homework description](./CS561-HW3.pdf).


## Usage

The neural network can be run against a training and testing dataset in the data folder (`train_image.csv`, `train_label.csv`, `test_image.csv`, `test_label.csv`) through the following commands:
```bash
python NeuralNetwork3.py
```

## Results

The player was tested against images from the MNIST dataset and those created by the course producers. A description of these test cases can be found in the homework description. The network performed to over 90% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, and over 55% accuracy on the hand-crafted dataset.
